Pray tell
Prithee
Thou must needs
Hark!
Methinks
Forsooth
Perchance
Whence
Verily
Art thou?
'Tis well
By my troth
Anon
Wherefore
Wilt thou?
Good morrow
Ne'er-do-well
Withal
Thusly
Forthwith
In sooth
Alas
Woe is me
'Tis a knavish trick
Godsooth
Haply
Ofttimes
'Twould seem
Aforementioned
Mayhaps
In good sooth
'Tis passing strange
Aught else?
With bated breath
By my word
Fie upon it!
On yon morrow
Eke out a living
Pray, beseech thee
Ne'ertheless
